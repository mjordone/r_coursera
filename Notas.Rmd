## Objects
R has five basic "atomic" classes of objects:
- character  
- numeric (real numbers)  
- integer 
- complex  
- logical (True/False)  

The most basic object is a **vector** (contains multiple copies of a single class of objects)  
There is one exception: a *list*, a vector that can have multiple different classes of objects.  

To create vector: `vector ()`.  
It has two basic elements: 1. The class of the object (the type), 2. The length of the vector itself  

Objects can also have names (useful for writing readable code and self-describing objects). Lists can also have names.

## Numbers
All numbers are numeric objects.  
"inf" is an special number
"NaN" is another number: an undefined value (or a missing value)

## Attributes
Part of objects, although not all objects have attributes  
Can be accessed through `attributes ()`.  
They can be names, dimnames, dimensions, class, length, other

## Matrices
They are special type of vector with a special attribute: dimension

## Factors
Another type of vectors created to represent categorical data. they can be unordered or ordered. Can be thought of as an integer vector where each integer has a label (i.e. what is usually is categorical variables). We can add lables to those integers.  
They are especial because they are treated specially by modling functions.

## Missing values
denoted NA or NaN

## Data Frames
It is what we use to store tabular data.  
Represented as a special type of list where every element of the list has to the same length (in order to be a table every column has to have the same length). However, each column doesn't need to be the same type. So it is like a matrix, but where the objects in each column can be of different class.  
Every row of a data fram has a name. The name can be something significant (e.g. the name of the interviewees) or just correlative numbers. `row.names`



```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
