## Objects
R has five basic "atomic" classes of objects:
- character  
- numeric (real numbers)  
- integer 
- complex  
- logical (True/False)  

The most basic object is a **vector** (contains multiple copies of a single class of objects)  
There is one exception: a *list*, a vector that can have multiple different classes of objects.  

To create vector: `vector ()`.  
It has two basic elements: 1. The class of the object (the type), 2. The length of the vector itself  

Objects can also have names (useful for writing readable code and self-describing objects). Lists can also have names.

## Numbers
All numbers are numeric objects.  
"inf" is an special number
"NaN" is another number: an undefined value (or a missing value)

## Attributes
Part of objects, although not all objects have attributes  
Can be accessed through `attributes ()`.  
They can be names, dimnames, dimensions, class, length, other

## Matrices
They are special type of vector with a special attribute: dimension

## Factors
Another type of vectors created to represent categorical data. they can be unordered or ordered. Can be thought of as an integer vector where each integer has a label (i.e. what is usually is categorical variables). We can add lables to those integers.  
They are especial because they are treated specially by modling functions.

## Missing values
denoted NA or NaN

## Data Frames
It is what we use to store tabular data.  
Represented as a special type of list where every element of the list has to the same length (in order to be a table every column has to have the same length). However, each column doesn't need to be the same type. So it is like a matrix, but where the objects in each column can be of different class.  
Every row of a data fram has a name. The name can be something significant (e.g. the name of the interviewees) or just correlative numbers. `row.names`

# About read.table
It is the most common function for reading data. Some important arguments:  
- file: the name of a file, or a connection  
- header: logical indicating if the file has a header line  
- sep: a string indicating how the colums are separated  
- colClasses: a character vector indicating the class of each column in the dataset  
- nrows: the number of rows in the dataset  
- comment.char: a character string indicating the comment character  
- skip: the number of lines to skip from the beginning  
- stringsAsFactors: should character varaibles be coded as factors?  

**Read the help page for read.table**. It contains many hints  
**For large datasets:**  
- Make a rough calculation of the memory required to store the dataset. I the datsaset is larger than the amount of RAM on the computer, stop.
- `colClasses` argument can make `read.table` much faster (prevents R from needing to figure out which type of data there is in every column). Example:  

```
initial <- read.table("datatable.txt", nrows = 100)
classes <- sapply(initial,class)
tabAll <- read-table("datatable.txt",
                    colClasses = classes)
```

Useful to know when working with large datasets: How much memory is available? what other applicatis are in use? are there other users logged into the same system? what operating system? Is teh OS 32 or 64 bit?

**Calculating memory requirements:** If all the data is numeric will be `nrows * ncolums * 8` bytes. I must divide it for 2^20 to get the MB. That will be the size of the dataset. Rule of thumb: I will need twice as memory as that.

## Textual formats
The advantage of this type of formats is that it contains metadata about the dataset (eg, classes of the columns). `dump` and `dput`. Problem is that they are not very space-efficient.

## Connections to the outside world
`file`: a connection to a file (gzfile and bzfile create connections to gzip and bzip2 compressed files)  
`url`: a connection to a webpage  

Connections can be useful if you want to read parts of a file




```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
